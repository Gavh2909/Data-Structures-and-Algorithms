# HAshing 

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used in various applications to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data. Here's a brief overview of hashing:

1. **Definition**: Hashing is the process of converting input data (such as a string, number, or object) into a fixed-size value (hash code) using a hash function.

2. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes an input (key) and produces a hash code, which is typically an integer value. The goal of a hash function is to map data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size output (hash code) in such a way that different inputs are likely to produce different hash codes.

3. **Hash Code**: The hash code is used as an index or address to store and retrieve data in data structures like hash tables, hash maps, and hash sets.

4. **Applications**:
   - **Data Retrieval**: Hashing allows for quick retrieval of data based on keys. For example, in a hash map, keys are hashed to determine their storage location, making lookups efficient.
   - **Data Integrity**: Hash codes can be used to verify data integrity by comparing hash codes before and after data transmission or storage. If the hash codes match, the data is likely unchanged.
   - **Password Hashing**: Hashing is commonly used in password storage. Instead of storing passwords directly, their hash codes are stored. When a user logs in, their input password is hashed, and the hash code is compared with the stored hash code.

5. **Collision Handling**: Collisions occur when two different inputs produce the same hash code. Hashing techniques include chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to handle collisions) and open addressing (probing to find alternative storage locations).

6. **Java**: In Java, hashing is used extensively in data structures like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`. The `hashCode()` method is used to generate hash codes for objects, and these codes are used for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Overall, hashing plays a crucial role in computer science and is a fundamental concept in areas such as data structures, cryptography, and security.
